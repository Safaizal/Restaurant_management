I am writing this learn the keywords on the new things that I will learn throughout the project.
so, Starting on json-server

To run the API in the website we have to create a file in our desktop and it can be stored in anywhere after that
I am creating like db and we need create a json file, I am created like "db.json", we can name as we want.

After writing the json file we need run that.
We have open commentpromt inside the db directory and write

json-server --watch db.json

You can see the API on port no 3000

We can also change the api to our need.

After that we are going to send the info to our API by using the Axios, first store the info in variables
then we need axios to post the values to the API, where axios.post() has 2 parameters 1st one is path of 
our API which is deployed and another one is object which has the variables that we store the info from our web page.

Note: whenever we call the API, it will give the result late, so we need to use async before the method.
async function will return the promise, whether we are returning something or not it will return the promises
And await keyword used to pause the executiton of the function until the it gets the promise.

Now we have the result, we can check the API page, It has update that means our API is working, then If we want
to store the info in localstorage we can do localstorage.setItem("name_What_you_want", JSON.stringify(result.data))
the result that we got is object.

By saving the data in the localstorage can help the data stable even the web page gets refreshed. with this we can make
sessions for the users...
