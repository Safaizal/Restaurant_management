I am writing this learn the keywords on the new things that I will learn throughout the project.
so, Starting on json-server

To run the API in the website we have to create a file in our desktop and it can be stored in anywhere after that
I am creating like db and we need create a json file, I am created like "db.json", we can name as we want.

After writing the json file we need run that.
We have open commentpromt inside the db directory and write

json-server --watch db.json

You can see the API on port no 3000

We can also change the api to our need.

After that we are going to send the info to our API by using the Axios, first store the info in variables
then we need axios to post the values to the API, where axios.post() has 2 parameters 1st one is path of 
our API which is deployed and another one is object which has the variables that we store the info from our web page.

Note: whenever we call the API, it will give the result late, so we need to use async before the method.
async function will return the promise, whether we are returning something or not it will return the promises
And await keyword used to pause the executiton of the function until the it gets the promise.

Now we have the result, we can check the API page, It has update that means our API is working, then If we want
to store the info in localstorage we can do localstorage.setItem("name_What_you_want", JSON.stringify(result.data))
the result that we got is object.

By saving the data in the localstorage can help the data stable even the web page gets refreshed. with this we can make
sessions for the users...

Now we are going to create a home component and routing to it from the sign up page, for routing we need
vue-router@next
where "@next" is for the latest version.
and create a file routers.js 

in that file we need to import the components to route and import these 
import {createRouter, createWebHistory} from 'vue-router'

create a routes array to give the path to each components

const routes = [
    {
        name: "Home",
        component: Home,
        path: '/'
    },
    {
        name: "SignUp",
        component: SignUp,
        path: '/SignUp'
    }
]

like this and then 

create the router 

const router = createRouter({
    history: createWebHistory(),
    routes
})

and export it then don't forgot to import the router on main.js 

Note: Don't forget whenever creating the component it should be multi value like HomePage not like Home
it is because it can create a conflict to the html tags like <home>

After these we can't see the routers in the web page to do that we need to put this inside the template

<router -view />

Router should work.

Now we need to route to the home page whenever the signup or user is created.

for that we need to give this code this.$router.push({name:"Home"}) this home should be equal to the same thing 
that you have written on the routes

const routes = [
    {
        name: "Home", <--- THIS ONE
        component: Home,
        path: '/'
    },
]

Now we need to use the api to login to the home page where we can do that with postman and json server, this json server provides a operation called 
filter where 
we have 

http://localhost:3000/users?email=hina@mail.com&password=345

we do like this in postman to filter the info but doing with json server like this is not safe, that's why we use backend server to authenticate these problems.
for now our motive is to learn the Vue

for posting the data by axios we use post method where this method gets two parameters 1st is link to the api
and another one is object with values.

axios.post (<link>, {
    <name> : this.<name>,
    ...
})

like this
