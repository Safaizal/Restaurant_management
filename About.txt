I am writing this learn the keywords on the new things that I will learn throughout the project.
so, Starting on json-server

To run the API in the website we have to create a file in our desktop and it can be stored in anywhere after that
I am creating like db and we need create a json file, I am created like "db.json", we can name as we want.

After writing the json file we need run that.
We have open commentpromt inside the db directory and write

json-server --watch db.json

You can see the API on port no 3000

We can also change the api to our need.
